# TU Delft Format for Quarto

## Installing

```zsh
quarto use template pat-alt/quarto-tudelft
```

This will install the extension and create an example `.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for your presentation.

Alternatively, if you've done this before, you can also add this template to an existing project like so:

```zsh
quarto add pat-alt/quarto-tudelft
```

## Updating

I will likely continue to improve this template. Updates can be fetched as follows:

```zsh
quarto update pat-alt/quarto-tudelft
```

## Usage

Usage is outlined in the template document: [template.qmd](template.qmd). You can find the rendered version here.
